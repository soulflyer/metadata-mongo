# metadata-mongo

A Clojure library designed to read the metadata from image files and store it in a mongo database. The images provided must be at a path that ends in /yyyy/mm/project/image.xxx The path is used to create the year month and project fields in the database. The id of the record created will be a concatenation of these. These fields will also be stored in the record.

## Usage

save-meta database-name collection-name image.jpg

or

save-meta database-name collection-name directory
